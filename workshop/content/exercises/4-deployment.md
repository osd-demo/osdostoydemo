## Deploy via a Kubernetes Deployment
One way to deploy the application would be to have the images for the front-end and back-end microservice containers already created (via CI/CD) and stored in an image repository.  You can then create Kubernetes deployments (YAML) and use those to deploy the application.  We will do that here.

#### 1. Retrieve the login command
If not logged in via the CLI, click on the dropdown arrow next to your name in the top-right and select *Copy Login Command*.

Then go to your terminal and paste that command and press enter.  You will see a similar confirmation message if you successfully logged in.

```
$ oc login https://api.demo1234.openshift.com --token=HS1QpKXXXXXXXXXXX
Logged into "https://api.demo1234.openshift.com" as "0kashi" using the token provided.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

    demo
  * shifty
  ...
```

#### 2. Create new project
Create a new project called "OSToy" in your cluster by entering the following command:

`oc new-project ostoy`

You should receive the following response

```
$ oc new-project ostoy
Now using project "ostoy" on server "https://api.demo1234.openshift.com:443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app centos/ruby-25-centos7~https://github.com/sclorg/ruby-ex.git

to build a new example application in Ruby.
```

Equivalently you can also create this new project using the web UI by selecting "Application Console" at the top  then clicking on "+Create Project" button on the right.

#### 3. Download the YAML configuration
Download the Kubernetes deployment object yamls from the following locations to your local machine, in a directory of your choosing (just remember where you placed them for the next step).

Feel free to open them up and take a look at what we will be deploying. For simplicity of this lab we have placed all the Kubernetes objects we are deploying for the front-end in an "all-in-one" yaml file.  Though in reality there are benefits (ease of maintenance and less risk) to separating these out into individual yaml files.

[ostoy-fe-deployment.yaml](/yaml/ostoy-fe-deployment.yaml)

[ostoy-microservice-deployment.yaml](/yaml/ostoy-microservice-deployment.yaml)

#### 4. Deploy the backend microservice
The microservice application serves internal web requests and returns a JSON object containing the current hostname and a randomly generated color string.

In your command line deploy the microservice using the following command:

`oc apply -f ostoy-microservice-deployment.yaml`

You should see the following response:
```
$ oc apply -f ostoy-microservice-deployment.yaml
deployment.apps/ostoy-microservice created
service/ostoy-microservice-svc created
```

#### 5. Deploy the front-end service
The frontend deployment contains the node.js frontend for our application along with a few other Kubernetes objects to illustrate examples.

 If you open the *ostoy-fe-deployment.yaml* you will see we are defining:

- Persistent Volume Claim
- Deployment Object
- Service
- Route
- Configmaps
- Secrets

In your command line deploy the frontend along with creating all objects mentioned above by entering:

`oc apply -f ostoy-fe-deployment.yaml`

You should see all objects created successfully

```
$ oc apply -f ostoy-fe-deployment.yaml
persistentvolumeclaim/ostoy-pvc created
deployment.apps/ostoy-frontend created
service/ostoy-frontend-svc created
route.route.openshift.io/ostoy-route created
configmap/ostoy-configmap-env created
secret/ostoy-secret-env created
configmap/ostoy-configmap-files created
secret/ostoy-secret created
```

#### 6. Get the route
Get the route so that we can access the application via `oc get route`

You should see the following response:

```
NAME          HOST/PORT                                     PATH      SERVICES              PORT      TERMINATION   WILDCARD
ostoy-route   ostoy-route-ostoy-osd.993f.demo1234.openshiftapps.com  ostoy-frontend-svc   <all>             None
```

#### 7. View the app
Copy `ostoy-route-ostoy-osd.993f.demo1234.openshiftapps.com` above and paste it into your browser and press enter.  You should see the homepage of our application.
